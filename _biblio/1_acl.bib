  abstract = {Carbonate formations are highly heterogeneous, and the velocity-porosity relationships are controlled by various microstructural parameters, such as the types of pores and their distribution. Because diagenesis is responsible for important changes in the microstructure of carbonate rocks, we have extended the standard effective medium approach to model the impact of diagenesis on the carbonate elastic properties through a step-by-step effective medium modeling. Two different carbonate rocks deposited, respectively, in lacustrine and marine environments are considered in this study. The first key step is the characterization of the diagenesis, which affected the two studied carbonate sample sets. Effective medium models integrating all of the geologic information accessible from petrographic analysis are then built. The evolution of the microstructural parameters during diagenesis is thoroughly constrained based on an extensive experimental data set, including X-ray diffraction analysis, different porosimetry methods, and ultrasonic velocity measurements. A new theoretical approach including two sources of compliance is developed to model the specific behavior of carbonates. A compliant interface is introduced around the main carbonate grains to represent grain contacts and the different pore scales are taken into account through multiscale modeling. Finally, direct calculations with the model provide elastic wave velocities representative of the different diagenetic stages. An extrapolation to permeability evolution is also introduced. This approach allows the identification of the acoustic signature of specific diagenetic events, such as dolomitization, dissolution, or cementation, and the assessment of their impact on the elastic properties of carbonates.},

  abstract = {In this work, we conducted an experimental and micromechanical investigation on the mechanical and chloride diffusion properties of recycled aggregates concrete (RAC). Due to the composite aspect of the recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), their impact on the properties of concretes is first evaluated by conducting an experimental campaign and further numerically modeled using micromechanical tools. Local mechanical properties of phases such as the attached mortar, the interfacial transition zones (ITZ) and the aggregates are also investigated by means of indentation tests at nano and microscale. Finally, experimentally informed multi scale model is established and the overall elastic modulus and chloride diffusion coefficient of concretes (with different rates of RCA) are computed and compared to experimental results at macroscopic scale for discussion. The established model provides a predictive tool for the mechanical and chloride diffusion properties of RAC.},

  abstract = {Creep and shrinkage of concrete are essential for the safety assessment of large civil engineering structures. The present paper presents two different approaches to predicting the delayed strain considering a single material point to represent the structure. The first one is a decoupled approach, such as design codes, that splits the delayed strain into four components and predicts each of them as a function of several parameters such as concrete strength. In the second approach, delayed strain is modeled as the viscoelastic response of concrete to applied external loads and/or internal hygric stresses. The advantages and inconveniences of both methods are discussed. In the end, delayed strains of concrete are predicted using these approaches for two examples of real structures: a prestressed concrete bridge and a mock-up of a biaxially prestressed containment building.},

Whereas the solution of this problem usually requires the calculation of the so-called fourth-order Hill polarization tensor if the ellipsoid is not singular, it is shown that the crack compliance can be derived from the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of the Hill tensor with respect to the smallest aspect ratio of the ellipsoidal inclusion. For a 3D ellipsoidal crack model, this first-order term is expressed as a simple integral thanks to the Cauchy residue theorem. A similar method allows to express the same term in the case of a cylindrical crack model without any integral. A numerical example is finally treated.},

  abstract = {The organization of the elementary components within the ultrastructure of mineralized tissues (bone and mineralized tendons) has provoked some controversy; especially with regard to its impact on the mechanical properties of the ultrastructure. Herein, we aim at shedding some light on the issue, by developing and verifying three different continuum-micromechanics representations of the collagen-mineral interaction in the elasticity of mineralized tissues: (i) mineral foam matrix with collagen inclusions, (ii) interpenetrating network of hydroxyapaptite crystals and collagen molecules, (iii) composite of fibrils (collagen-hydroxyapatite network) embedded in a collagen-free extrafibrillar mineral foam matrix. The validation of the different concepts, based on independent sets of experiments, shows remarkable predictive capabilites of the different micromechanical representations. Still, there are significant differences in the performance of these three different micromechanical concepts, related to the sophistication with which the ultrastructure of bone is modelled. Consideration of the fibrillar organization of bone ultrastructure improves over simpler concepts like an interpenetrating network of mineral crystals and collagen molecules, which in turn is superior to a crystal-foam representation with collagen inclusions. In fact, the most advanced concept treated here integrates the two others to a consistent whole: Each fibril is regarded as an interpenetrating network of collagen molecules and mineral crystals. The fibrils host the minority of the mineral crystals present in the tissues. At a higher observation scale, the fibrils function as templates or reinforcement in an extrafibrillar crystal foam-type matrix, which hosts the majority of the minerals present in the bone ultrastructure. The reinforcement function corresponds to low-mineralized tissues (such as deer antler) where the extrafibrillar mineral foam is softer than the fibrils, whereas the template function corresponds to high-mineralized tissues (such as cow tibia) where the extrafibrillar mineral foam is stiffer than the fibrils. The collagen is clearly represented as the governing element in inducing the anisotropy of the tissues, by (i) the anisotropy of molecular collagen itself, (ii) the anisotropy of the fibrils, and (iii) the oriented morphology of the cylindrical fibrils in the isotropic extrafibrillar space. ©2004 Elsevier SAS.

  abstract = {The effects of short and long-term thermo-oxidative aging on stripping resistance, rut depth, stiffness modulus, fracture and fatigue resistances of asphalt concretes have been assessed. A modified RILEM thermo-oxidative aging procedure on loose asphalt mixtures has been used to evaluate the gradual evolution of these properties with the aging duration. Two short-term aging durations (4 and 8 hours at 135∘C) and three long-term thermo-oxidative aging durations (3, 6 and 9 days at 85∘C) and a reference mixture (0 day aging) have been considered to this end. The impact of long-term thermo-oxidative aging on the chemo-rheological properties of recovered asphalt binders have been investigated. At the binder scale, the results show an increase in the Fraass temperature, the softening point, the shear modulus |G∗|, the aging index (AI=IS0 + IC0) and a decrease in the penetration grade with the aging duration. Some correlations between the viscoelastic transition parameters (TVET, GVET and ωVET) of the recovered asphalt binders and the aging index have been established. At the mixture scale, the results show that the stiffness modulus (|E∗|) increases with the aging duration, while the index of fracture resistance (IFR), the stripping resistance (CW/CD), the rut depth (P) and the fatigue deformation (ε6) decrease with the aging duration. Finally, some correlations between the aging index and the rheological and the mechanical properties of binders and concretes (|G∗|, |E∗|, P, IFR, ε6) have been proposed.},
