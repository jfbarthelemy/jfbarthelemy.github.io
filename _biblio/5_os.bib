  abstract = {In this work, we focus on the effect of non-ellipsoidal concave pore on thermal conduction properties of porous media with an infinite transversely isotropic matrix. This effect is described by the resistivity contribution tensors that will be computed via the Finite Elements (FE)-based numerical homogenization. The FE computations will be carried out with some adapted and bounded boundary conditions that are formulated as dependent of the Green function and its gradient for the three-dimensional Poisson’s equation in infinite anisotropic medium. It allows to incorporate the matrix anisotropy and the correction of the bias induced by the bounded character of the mesh domain. The boundary conditions are constructed and applied in such a way that they accelerate the convergence of numerical computations, and therefore preserve the accuracy of estimations. This is proved after several appropriate assessment and validation by comparing its predictions, in some particular cases, with analytical results and some available numerical ones. Finally, the effect of the pore concavity as well as that of the matrix anisotropy on the resistivity contribution tensor are quantitatively illustrated.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to extend recent elastic work to thermal problem. In the first part of the paper, approximate relations for the resistivity contribution tensor of pores of two reference shapes, supersphere and axisymmetrical superspheroid, are developed on the basis of 3D Finite Element Modelling, presented in the companion paper, and known exact solutions for the limiting cases of spherical pores. In the second part application to effective elastic coefficients of transversely isotropic materials such as clay rocks, in the frame of homogenization theory, is presented to illustrate the impact of concavity parameter on overall properties.},
