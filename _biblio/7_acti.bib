  abstract = {This work aims at putting in evidence the coupled effects of both delayed de- formations of concrete and relaxation of prestressing steel on the long term behavior of long span bridges. After recalling the possible origins of delayed deformations of pre- stressed concrete structures, the example of the Savines bridge is presented. This 65- year-old bridge shows excessive deflections at mid-spans which can not be predicted by the current Eurocode 2 creep laws, unless artificial coefficients are adjusted. Then a simplified prestressed cantilever beam is considered allowing to quasi-analytically address the problem of interaction between concrete creep and steel relaxation. The resolution of this problem with ageing material laws which are adapted from Eurocode 2 highlights the importance of the evolution of steel tendons after decades and allows to question the validity of laws used in models and the difficulty to identify the contri- butions of concrete and steel in the evolution of the deflection.},
